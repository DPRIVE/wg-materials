## Opportunistic Encryption (draft-pp-recursive-authoritative-opportunistic) - 20 minutes

Ben Schwartz: Support adoption; authenication text should be removed. Current text does not make clear what identity one authenicate with. 

Paul Hofmann: We could include two. 

BS: Transport cache not clear what it is keyed on - ipaddr or nameserver. 

PH: Draft Should specify. 

Duane Wessels: Support adoption as well, TLSA think is a better mechanism. 

Peter van Dijk: Support adoption. Good middle ground. TLSA has a problem with NS data is not signed. Still be leaking domain name. 

PH/PvD: 853 is a bit overloaded. Allocate a separate port for Auth DoT. 

PH: DoQ would be a better solution within five years. 

PvD:  Seperate document for another port

BS: should use 853. DNS transport layer. TLSA may end up playing a role in authenication. 



## Opportunistic encryption from resolvers perspective - 40 minutes

BS: Opportunistic encryption is valuabale, especially for shaking out resource issues.

PvD: What Ben says. 

Opportunistic encryption from authoritative perspective - 40 minutes

PvD: agreements on Cloudflare/FB sending ECS because of using TLS. 

Ralf Weber: does not like probing, but with opportunistic is the only way. I really would like the authenticted recursive way also go forward.

PvD: Document should not document authenication at all. 

PvD: Wonder if Duane or TLS operators would comment on opening up for DoT.

Duane: cannot comment

Jim Reid: TLD operators run servers run by different partners, so supporting TLS could be tricky. 

Scott Hollenbeck: Verisign has no plans to support at this times. Concerns about unknown resource consumption and performance considerations. 

Paul Hofmann: TLD w/Multiple providers and transport cache. Turn on TLS on secondary servers to watch performance. 

Allison Mankin:  Asked what the privacy assurance intended to the users is, if it will be common for some servers in footprint to not have TLS enabled?  For soft rollout - can use NS not in the NS RRSet and test against. Is it in scope for the document to advise privacy-centric recursive operators to maintain state of which authoritative addresses serve DoT? 

JR: TTL of A records of NS Records are very short. 

Alex Mayhofer: if key is ip address, considerations documnted for anycast.

PH: No on privacy guarantee (Allisons Q1). Gives Privacy oriented resolvers a non documentable way of doing things (Q3). Does not want this document to describe what to key on. 

BS: on topic for turning for one nameserver - one NS record or one IP address. Issue with transport caches. More extreme for anycast rollouts. 

Stephen Farrell: TLS found reporting to be useful initially. 

PvD: Draft too perscriptive. Should describe concerns w/out saying what to do.

JR: 

## Going Forward

CfA on Opportunistic Encryption, could WG adopt even with discussion from today

BS: Need some interopt testing. 

PH: used to run interopt events. watching but not participating. 

AM: Really like Interopt events. NDSS on 2/21/2021 https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2021/
