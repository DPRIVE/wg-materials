Mini Agenda:
  - Erik/Ben talk TLS-Android
  - Sara talks Stubby
  - Alex talks padding policy
  - Other Business

### Chairs

drpive probably meet in London
       should be a rechartering

res-auth stuff will ultimately hit ICANN and then fail
         how would TLS be done at the root?
         usual ICANN policy quagmire
Tim said 8.8.8.8 has some interest in TLS for DNS
anycast service from PCH for TLS/DNS - real soon now

### DTLS on Android

Ben Schwartz & Erik Kline showed demo of DTLS on Android

phone has no custom code - standard build since last week
          maybe later over quic
          settings offer opportunistic mode/off select provider
          captive portal checks
showed traffic to port 853
every recursive with this android build will query 853 by default
            prove there's no enormous latency
            no pipelining yet - but it may be needed
            some kernel hacks - TLS false start(?)
more implementation guidance would help
will fallback to port 53 if port 853 gets blocked or dropped
probably ~1 year away from general release - depends on QA and so on
no support for padding
when latency issue cropped up, why not use dnscrypt or dnscurve?
     no I-D so google developers rejected the question

operation and discovery ideas

Tom Pusteri has an iOS client - blocked by an apple bug
    apple guy offers to expedite the bug report (Chris Wood?)

Warren has TLSA records provisioned for DNS/TLS on his server

### Stubby

Sara
        Working with Packet Clearinghouse on resolvers
        windows installer released for stubby - Willem Toorop did it
        generated lots of interest, feedback and bug reports
        Sara working on a lightweight client GUI for mac - next week?
             windows version later

DNS privacy workshop in San Diego in Q1 2017
    joint session with security usability workshop maybe
    CFP is on the NDSS web site

### Padding Policy

padding: 128 bytes on client, 426 on server according to dkg's recommendation
         90% of query/response pairs fit that profile
        Alex: draft is still experimental
              roll another rev and go to WGLC in December
        no empirical data yet on padding sizes
           need more academic work
           padding policy size might identify too much about the client
        wg doesn't have enough info on dkg's threat model yet
        #padding bits/query could leak too much info for zillions of lookup for say cnn.com
        trade-offs between packet size v battery length

large-scale deployment in ~1 year - PCH servers and Android clients

questions about long-lived TCP connection
          Alison mentioned Wes & John Heideman's paper on trade offs
          Sara said stubby's 10-second idle timeout annoys users

### Chairs Actions:

  - Brian will run WGLC on padding policy
  - Tim and Brian will work on charter text
    - Terry says sooner rather than later.
  Look for common set of metrics to collect.
