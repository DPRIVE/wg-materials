## Agenda

### Meeting logistics (scribes, jabber, etc.)
    Tim Wicinski - minutes

### Interim objectives


### Discussion of requirements/goals for DNS privacy between recursive resolvers and authoritative servers

Benno Discusses https://trac.ietf.org/trac/dprive/wiki/DPriveStage2

Paul Wouters: Anonymous DNS vs Authenicated Queries ? 

Paul Hoffman: Edited wording on connection/connectionless text submitted by Erik Nygren. 

Mukund:  Cost of TLS connections.  Resolver makes several requests in sequence in HTTPS. 
Cost of TLS over UDP will significantly hamper end user experience. 

Stephen Farrell:  Zone Owners/Registrant have a perspective. 

PW:  How far to go to prevent it not being blocked? 

Jon Reed:  Discussion with pros/cons on where to draw the line on these. 

Karl Henderson:  No TLS between of recursive /auth unless stub/recursive

DKG: Cut these use cases functionally. 

SF:  why should stub/recursive TLS be required for  recursive/authoratittive? 

BH:  

SF: Should not be a protocol requirements

DKG: Do you have to treat your cache differently if receive over private vs non-private link 

JR: Discuss out-of-baliwicks authorities 

Wes Hardeker:  

Mukund:  Security and Privacy 

DKS: recursive resolver just been stood up. being observed. 

PH: Two Caches with different privacy.  Don't propose to do this work

MS: Two different caches, data resolvers learned over the different transport. 

### Large Root/TLD Operator observations, Henderson

Recursive vs Authorative: users can't avoid a work around. 
Should focus on availability

look at: 
- DNS-over-TLS
- performance, attack vectors
- authorative profile  

DKG: Focus on DoT is reasonable. 

TW: Similar to DNSEC? 

KH: New attack vectors, etc. 

DKS: What new attacks

KH: DDoS

DKS: Give clear guidance on balancing availability over privacy 

PH: Use case then becomes opportunistic. 

DKG: Don't Agree

PH: I said opportunistic not none 

DKG: 

WH: Explicity named secondary

DKS: Functional Split to signal availability 
How do we signal availability? 
- not at all, opportunistic try 
- per zone, 
- per nameserver, 
- per IP Address 

SF:  Inheritance for subdomains 

KH: Capability signaling that tony finch is working

DKG:  specifically formed domain names. 

WH: clarifying question - only use to put in name to get speed 

DKG: Name propogated already (glue, etc)

PH: 63 character library limits for 

Russ:
