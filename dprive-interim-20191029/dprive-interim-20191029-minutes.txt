Few minor changes
Stephen Farrel's changes 
Significant Issue - inclusion of text around consent. 
Question is should we be addressing this in this draft. 

last version drop statement "won't do X without your consent"
new item requested operator policy for consent. 

SF: Document is nearly Ok but not fully Ok. 
operators can get consent when they can't get consent. 
SD: Most policy documents do use this language.
maybe this can be couche.d 

BH: Teased out of the conversation, service provider consent 
does not capture user provider agreement in place.
better delination between the two points. 

Ben Scwartz:  BCP should observed practices more than once, working well.

BS: 
SF:  Does consent exist? it's a DNS Query
BS: NextDNS (nextdns.io) - customized recursive operations as a service

Ralf Weber: A corner case
BS:  BCP should reflect practices we observe. Quesiton on consent language. 
SD: Open Resolvers use this exact language, claim a consent model. 
Brian Dickson: Consent is moot 
SF: Many things on the web claim consent.
Allison Mankin:  Maybe what you want is "we don't believe" make this a strong 
statement. Don't assume or talk about it until you know more. 

SF: If we drop the consent. 
SD: Dropping 6 of 6.1.2
BS: Using Quad-9 as example, 
SD: Cloudflare's privacy statement
SF: It's Waffle. 
Jason Livingood:  What's the agreement with a browser pointing to Cloudflare
Alex Mayrhofer: 

BD: Maybe restructure the text
AM: Look at Appendix C.2 text
SF: 

Action:  Chairs will follow up on Consent Discussion. 

### New Work

* Recursive to Authoritative Privacy Requirements
     - draft-lmo-dprive-phase2-requirements
     - Authors

Alex Mayerhof presenting

RW: Disagree with requirements. Make as simple as possible with DNS model

Alex: sjhould not differenate between TLD and SLD 

RW: Large DNS deployments do not appear on internet

BD: QNAME min reduces need for DoT to DoT 

BS: QNAME min should be mandatory.  Others are operational requirements
