DNS-SD is looking for a new chair, contact Terry Manderson if
interested.

David Schinazi: Shameless plug: DNS-SD is working on better privacy.  Go
to their Thursday morning session.

Chairs: Padding policy is addressing IESG comments. Moving it soon

* Agenda Bashing, Blue Sheets, etc,  10 min

### Current Working Group Business

* Some analysis of the RIPE Atlas probe data on DNS-Privacy, Brian
* Haberman, 10 min

DNS over TLS was done quickly - way to go RIPE ATLAS folks!

Sara Dickinson: Was 853 blocked?
Brian: number of connections refused, but there were also timeouts.
Still need to document them.
Sara: Can you also do it over 443?
Brian: Need to look at API.

Daniel Khan Gillmor(DKG): Looks great.  How many of the RIPE probes did
the servers test?
Brian: The 41K queries came out of 2500 different probes.  They have
roughlhy X probes.  Looking at setting queires based on class of probes.
Going to update stats.
DKG: Also looking at reachability. 
Brian: Probe just does a reachability.

Nick Sullivan: what I don't see is traffic analysis.
Sara: It's there :)

* Sara Dickinson, 25 min
Barry Greene: We need to break this into two documents.  Missing a
section on resiliancy, e.g., cables to NZ go down now what?  Operators
like IoT because they got certificates and you can then see behind the
NAT.  If you keep everything in one document, folks will never be able
to fully comply.

Paul Hoffman: It's fine to have it one draft.  What is your timeframe?
One of the things we've found recenlty is that people do whoziwazts
unless ...

Sara: We think it's going to be living document.  This is one of the
reasons we were hesitent to bring it here.  It'll go slow. Huge changes
expected next year.

Dan York: Like the draft.  It's good to have it here.  Building on work
of DPRIVE and DOH. Privacy parts feel like it should be it's own
seperate thing because it's a different audience.

DKG: LIke and appreciate the work.  I think it should all be in one doc.

Lorenzo Colitti: If we want to publish a doc, then publishing one with
data retention is going to be incredibly hard (wrong people, laws
change).  We should figure out what we can publish and do that.

Jonathan: What's the plan to get ISPs to work with this draft (right now
it's targeted at clouds)?
Sara: Could offer to services.  Which ones is the default is TBD.

Alison Mankin: We are spinning up an IRTF RG about privacy enhanced
tech.  It might be reasonable for the RG to take this up.  This draft
could be referenced.
Sara: Some of this is definitely research.

DKG: We are not writing a legal doc. We should expect to change and
update the document in time as BCPs change. 

Chairs: We're going to do a WG call for adoption (now). Also read the
bis draft.

### New Working Group Business

* [draft-annee-dprive-oblivious-dns](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-annee-dprive-oblivious-dns/),
* Nick Feamster, 15 min

Slides:

DKG: Thanks for this.  I like the framing of it.  How does your threat
modeal deal with ODNS and recursive being colocated?
??: WE talked about this at the hackathon.  But, performance suggests
they be close.  Still lots of questions there.

Tobias: How are you handling DNSSSEC?  Don't we as an ISP get an name
oracle?
Nick: : Othoganal and complimentary.  Sure the ISP can see a netflow and
figure something out.  Shared hosting addresses some of this, but not
all concerns.  This doesn't make anything worse.

ekr: Interesting idea.  The recursive area free IP anonymizer (yep).
Surprised how the ODNS key is secured?  Why ECIS and not straight DH?
Can get you more bytes.
Nick: We need to talk about how to secure they key.  Great would love
the bytes!

Barry Greene: Interesting - Increased cost, complexity, and maybe
fragility.  What security problem are you solving?  There is a
disconnect with the IETF and the mobile speed requirements.
Nick: It's a privacy problem not a security problem.  Domain by domain
solution.

Chris Wood: Concerned that the ODNS server becomes a central point of
failure?  Can you comment on how this affects caches?
Nick: It's a concern, but we can think about resiliance but we think
normal techniques would work.  Caching benefits move to ODNS
authoritative.  This breaks shared caching?
Chris Wood: Are there operators who think per-client caching works?

Jinmei Tatuya: This is interesting and hope to see more details about
how to implement in the next version.  EDNS cannot force recursive
server to forward OPT RR.  So as long as the protocol relies on EDNS,
forwarding it should be part of the protocol, not just an implementation
consideration.

Witold KrÄ™cicki: Are there any meassures against using ODNS server?  Any
fallback if QN is too long?
Nick: For fallback - we'd like the group to think about it.  There are
concerns about profiling.

Dmitry Kohmanyuk (?): Using anycast fine.  how do you rekey?
NicK: Session keys can be per query.

## Stage 2

* Recursive to Authorative discussion,  Chairs, 30 min

Probably going to need an interim to go over the two main points.

Paul Hoffman: Can we start talking about it on the interim!?
Chairs: Oh yeah!!  We'll give guidance in the next day or so.

Benno Overeinder: I'll include some operator considerations.
