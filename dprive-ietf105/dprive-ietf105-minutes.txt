Using Early Data in DNS over TLS, draft-ghedini-dprive-early-data, Alessandro Ghedini
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/105/materials/slides-105-dprive-using-early-data-in-dns-over-tls-draft-ghedini-dprive-early-data-00
Stéphane Bortzmeyer: The exmples should be RRtypes
Karl Henderson: Are there side-channel attacks with replay?
Alessandro: DKG commented on this earlier, need to add more

Recommendations for DNS Privacy Service Operators, draft-ietf-dprive-bcp-op, Roland van Rijswijk-Deij 
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/105/materials/slides-105-dprive-draft-ietf-dprive-bcp-op-00
Think they are ready for WG Last Call, but it would be a living document
Maybe do a -bis in two years
Paul Hoffman: Chrome will have a TRR, should we wait for that? Not sure.
Brian: Please read both this one and rfc7626-bis so we can decide when to do WG Last Call

DNS Zone Transfers over TLS, draft-hzpa-dprive-xfr-over-tls, Pallavi Aras and Han Zhang
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/105/materials/slides-105-dprive-dns-zone-transfer-over-tls-xot-01
Draft suggests to reuse the TLS session open instead of opening for each XOT-based IXFR
Wes Hardaker: Glad this is being documented. Are you adding anything new?
Pallavi: Correct, just new transports
Willem Toorop: Improves on current AXFR by suggesting better operations such as pipelining
Ben Kaduk: Should always use secure transports for sensitive data
Doesn't think you need to force TLS 1.3
Roland: If you keep the session open for multiple XFRs, you will signal that there is relationship between the two parties
Maybe consider making shorter
Willem: There might not be much of a relationship
Allison Mankin: Natural proposed standard because it updates current ones
Daniel Kahn Gillmor: If you use TLS 1.3 you can get the session keys for future sessions based on 0RTT
Padding is useful for confidentiality
Think of padding as framing for the TLS records
Wes: Wants "MUST be TSIG protected", but if they don't care what the name is, it might be optional
Pallavi: Actually, want it for the performance
Sean Turner: Make TLS 1.3 mandatory
Daniel: Agrees

DNS Zone Transfer using DNS Stateful Operations, draft-zatda-dprive-xfr-using-dso, Willem Toorop and Sara Dickinson
     https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/105/materials/slides-105-dprive-zone-transfer-using-dso-xud-01
     Matt Pounsett: Definite interest
     It is fine to allow support for TLS, but not require it
Mattijs Mekking: Could be thousands of subscriptions
Could be additional features
Think about the scope of the document
Supports this work
Sara: DSO is extensible so can add TLVs later
Ted Hardie: Question of making TLS optional
Encrypt at all times
Require TLS
Petr Špaček: Doesn't think is should be this one
Should do a proper transfer protocol 
Not in favor of this at all
Willem: Almost existing transport
Daniel: Must be TLS
Why use TSIG in this? Weird mix of things
Willem: TSIG is end-to-end, might go through proxies
TSIG is replayable
Sets off his warning flags
Willem: would allow the primary to authenticate the secondary
Matt: I trust you to transfer this zone and I don't care when you are transfering from
Doesn't care about TLS authentication
Likes having TSIG for client authentication
Pallavi: TSIG gives data authenticity
Wes: Two halves: push notification / secure
Should be DNSOP, this feels like the wrong place
Puneet Sood: Agrees with Petr, wants to start from a zone transfer design
Brian: Will talk with Tim about how to proceed

Bootstrapping Procedure to Discover and Authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS Servers, draft-reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server, Michael Richardson
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/105/materials/slides-105-dprive-bootstrapping-procedure-to-discover-and-authenticate-dot-and-doh-servers-v2-00
Sean: Do you really need a new certificate extension?
Michael: Yes, for policy, but maybe we need to be in that space
Michael: Not sure if they even want this adopted yet, maybe too nebulous at this point
Michael was speaking about: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-peterson-dot-dhcp/ 
which is from Thomas Peterson, not Thomas Fossati!

Deploying DNS-over-TLS on Authoritative Servers, draft-hal-adot-operational-considerations, Tim April
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/105/materials/slides-105-dprive-authoritative-dns-over-tls-operational-considerations-draft-hal-adot-operational-considerations-00
Has a discussion of how to discover if the server is running DoT
Karl: Also thinking about downgrade prevention
